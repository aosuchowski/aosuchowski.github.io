...just as Kramer said to Woody Allen.

Hi, I'm Alex, welcome to my blog page. If you got here, I'm not sure how.

I have created this blog just as a curiosity. I thought it would be nice to have a place to jot things down that I find interesting or want to remember. At this stage, I can't promise it will be interesting or useful for anyone else besides me.
