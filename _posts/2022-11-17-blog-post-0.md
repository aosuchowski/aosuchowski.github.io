## Blog post 0

This is my first (I think ever?) blog/blog post.

Today I learned (TIL) how to set up a blog using GitHub Pages with the help of Chad Baldwin's great, easy to follow tutorial. If I had started this blog last week I could've written TIL what the acronym TIL means, which I learned by reading Simon Willison's blog post about starting a blog (which was part of the inspiration for starting this blog).

Here is a random code block (just to see how it works):

 ```python
 print("hello blog world")
 ```
 
And here is how to display `inline code`. This was created by surrounding the term "inline code" with back-ticks. I don't think I have ever intentionally typed a back-tick in my life up until now. I had to search my laptop keyboard to find it, and when I did (with the help of a post on Stack Exchange's superuser site), hey cool there is that little beauty!

### In summary...

I'm looking forward to learning more about Markdown and Jekyll by having this blog on Github Pages. I'm not really sure if I will end up actually blogging a lot, but we shall see! It's fun to learn how to do it at the very least.

<!-- ## Blog Post Title From First Header

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
