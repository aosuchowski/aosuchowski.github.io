## Blog 0, blog post 0

This is my first (I think ever?) blog/blog post.

Today I learned (TIL) how to set up a blog using GitHub Pages with the help of Chad Baldwin's great, easy to follow tutorial. If I had started this blog last week I could've written TIL what the acronym TIL means, which I learned by reading Simon Willison's blog post about starting a blog (which was part of the inspiration for starting this blog).

Here is a random code block (just to see how it works):

 ```python
 print("hello blog world")
 ```
 
And here is some random `inline code` <-- this was created by surrounding the term "inline code" with back-ticks. I don't think I have ever intentionally typed a back-tick in my life up until now. I had to search my laptop keyboard to find it, and when I did (with the help of a post on Stack Exchange's superuser site), hey cool there is that little beauty!

### In summary...

I'm looking forward to learning more about Markdown and Jekyll by having this blog on Github Pages. I'm not really sure if I will end up actually blogging a lot, but we shall see! It's fun to learn how to do it at the very least.
