## This is my first blog post!

TIL how to set up a blog using GitHub Pages with the help of Chad Baldwin's great, easy to follow tutorial. If I had started this blog last week I could've written TIL what TIL is an acronym for, which I learned by reading Simon Willison's blog post about starting a blog, which was part of the inspiration for starting my blog.

Here is a random code block (just to see how it works):

 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
 
And here is some random `inline code` <-- this was created by surrounding the term "inline code" with back-ticks. I don't think I have ever used a back-tick in my life up until now. I had to search my laptop keyboard to find it, and when I did, cool!

I'm looking forward to learning more about Markdown and Jekyll by having this blog on Github Pages. I'm not really sure if I will end up actually blogging a lot, but we shall see! It's fun to learn how to do it at the very least.
